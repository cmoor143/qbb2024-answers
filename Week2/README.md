# Step 2.3

1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

I think that exons are under the highest level of purifying selection because as MAF increases, their values decrease

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases?

The enrichment of features at low MAFs because of purifying selection, which keeps deleterious variants in functional regions at low frequencies. As MAF increases, the SNPs are less likely to be deleterious and more likely to be neutral variants or subject to genetic drift, leading to the depletion of enrichment in functional features at higher frequencies.

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
Yes, the relative levels of enrichment and depletion between features likely make sense because different genomic regions are subject to varying degrees of selective pressure.
