# Question 1.1: Can you think of a reason why this sample does not match the expected GC content distribution and base content at the beginning of sequences?

I am assuming that we likely see a difference between expected GC content because we are only looking at RNAseq. data from the Drosophila midgut and not the entire fly. 

# Question 1.2: What is the origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample? Does it make sense?

The origin of the most overrepresented sequence is from serine protease 1, 2, and 3. This makes sense because the midgut, especially in organisms like insects or mammals, is a site of significant digestive enzyme activity, where serine proteases play a key role.

# Question 2.1: If you were to reject any samples with the percentage of unique reads less than 45%, how many samples would you keep?

You would keep 15 samples.

# Question 2.2: Can you see the blocks of triplicates clearly? Try adjusting the min slider up. Does this suggest anything about consistency between replicates?

Each triplicate cluster of replicates appears to be more similar to other clusters, indicating a high level of consistency across different experimental rounds.

# Question 3.1 (Step 3.3): What does the PCA plot suggest to you about the data? Why?

LFC-Fe Replicate 3 and Fe Replicate 1 seem to have been mislabeled or swapped.

# Question 3.2 (Step 3.6): Do the categories of enrichments make sense? Why?

Yes because most of the enrichments seem to be related to metabolic processes, which makes sense considering they are derived from midgut tissues.
