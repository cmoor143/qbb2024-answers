## Question 3.1
The nascent RNA signal reflects the level of nascent RNA within a cell's nucleus, serving as an indicator of active transcription. This value is calculated as the average signal across each nucleus within a specific field and knockdown condition, represented in 32-bit format.

The PCNA signal indicates the amount of PCNA in a cell's nucleus, representing DNA replication and repair activity. Like the nascent RNA signal, it is measured as the average signal across each nucleus in a given field and knockdown condition, also in 32-bit format.

The ratio of nascent RNA to PCNA signals provides a measure of the balance between RNA transcription and DNA replication activities.

## Question 3.2
SRSF1 exhibits the highest ratio, which aligns with its role in regulating splicing. Nascent RNA transcripts are often identified through the presence of introns. If introns are not efficiently spliced out, knocking down SRSF1 could lead to an accumulation of "nascent" transcripts within the nucleus, thereby increasing the numerator in the ratio.

APEX1 shows the lowest ratio, which is consistent with its function in DNA repair. PCNA serves as a marker for DNA repair processes, including those mediated by Polymerase epsilon. Knocking out APEX1 typically leads to the accumulation of DNA damage, increasing the denominator of the ratio and resulting in a lower overall value.
